# Decisions

Short records of choices that are easy to second-guess later. Each has the
reason and what would change our mind.

## 1. Event log over state replication

Reason: every recurring failure in LangQuest v2 and Codex traces to merging
mutable state. See PLAN.md section 2. Reverse if: a use case appears that needs
real-time co-editing of one artifact, in which case add a CRDT for that
artifact only.

## 2. Intent events with per-type merge rules, not a CRDT library

Reason: the domain's writes are per-actor appends and a few registers. Two
merge shapes cover everything. A library adds a dependency and a mental model
for no gain. Reverse if: more than a handful of event types need non-trivial
merge behaviour.

## 3. Clients materialize alone; server folds are optional and async

Reason: translators must see their own work instantly and offline. Server
folds serve coordinators and cold start only. Reverse if: never; this is the
property that keeps support cost down.

## 4. Content-addressed immutable audio

Reason: makes audio conflict-free and uploads idempotent by construction.
The v2 app already never mutates audio in place; this makes it a rule.

## 5. Hand-rolled sync before LiveStore

Reason: the core is a reducer, a SQLite cache, and two endpoints. LiveStore is
pre-1.0 and its one-log-per-store model only fits now that the partition is
the project. Reverse if: the reactive query layer or multi-tab handling
becomes a real cost, once LiveStore is stable.

## 6. Scale rules from day one (Swarnendu De)

Reason: the advice matched what we had already chosen (read/write separation,
async processing, business logic apart from infrastructure) and exposed two
gaps we then closed: tenant keys and an index plan on every event from the
start, and per-org rate limits and bounded pull pages instead of assuming
"we'll add them later".

## 7. Design language first, then the UX spec's screens

Reason: the UX spec prototype (`ng-langquest-ux`) defines the screen
breakdown and flows, but its purple, text-first styling is a Figma Make
default. We keep its screens, ids, and navigation, and render user screens
in the LangQuest v2 task-first language: one yellow action, icon-encoded
status, 6% tints, colourblind-safe pairs of colour and icon. Admin screens
may use the spec's text density. Reverse if: partner testing shows oral
users need labels after all; then add labels beside icons, never instead.

## 8. Every screen names its avatar

Reason: user and project-manager screens have opposite constraints (icons
versus text, one action versus all options). A comment at the top of each
screen file names the avatar so nobody applies the wrong rules. See
PLAN.md section 12.

## 9. Submission is an explicit event

Reason: UX spec A30. Recordings save the moment they are made; review starts
only when the translator hands the take off. Without `TakeSubmitted`, a
reviewer would see half-finished work. It also gives To Do / Doing / Done
a clean definition: nothing, draft, handed off.

## 10. Reviews suggest, they do not reject

Reason: UX spec A11 and the review screens. A reviewer's "suggest changes"
is advisory and returns the passage to the translator as a respond task.
The quorum rule still treats it as a non-approval, so a required step with
enough suggestions leaves the take in `changes_requested` until a new take
is submitted.

## 11. Personas are real users, and a shared device pushes only its actor's events

Reason: a dev persona that only fakes session facets would emit events the
server rejects (actorId must match the caller). So switching persona is a
real sign-in as a seeded account, and "seed demo team" creates those
accounts and their memberships through the same events a coordinator would
use. Consequence for production: a shared phone can hold several users'
queued events; the client pushes only the current actor's, so nobody's
work is refused under someone else's session.

## 12. No accidental sign-out offline

Reason: queued events belong to the signed-in user and cannot be sent under
anyone else. Sign-out lives behind a confirmation screen that refuses while
anything is queued or the device is offline, and shows why with icons
rather than words. The old header sign-out icon became the menu.

Amended (2026-09-28): being offline alone no longer refuses sign-out, and a
server refusal of this actor never traps them (PLAN.md section 11 step 4).
What refuses is work this session could still deliver: queued project and
org events, account changes and audio not yet uploaded. The screen says
which.

## 13. Two recorders, on purpose

Reason: expo-audio allows one recording at a time and exposes no PCM. v2
solved this with a custom Expo module (`microphone-energy`) that taps raw
PCM for energy and voice-activity segmentation and writes one WAV per card,
while expo-audio writes hold-to-record takes. Both sessions are open during
manual recording. We reuse that module unchanged rather than re-solving the
cold-start and segmentation problems it already solved. Cost: no Expo Go;
a dev client build is required.

## 14. Confirmation is an event, not a column

Reason: v2 stamped `audio_uploaded_at` on rows and needed guard triggers to
stop clients echoing it back. Here the storage trigger appends
`v1.BlobStored` to the project log under the service actor, `append_events`
refuses the type from any client, and devices learn of it through the pull
they already do. Same guarantee, no extra column, no extra sync path.

## 15. Device identity and clocks are persisted

Reason: the fold's last-writer-wins registers depend on HLCs being unique
across devices and monotonic on each one. The first mobile build used the
same device id everywhere and forgot its clock on restart; on a phone whose
clock was corrected backwards, a user's newer decision lost to their older
one. Now `ensureDeviceId` mints one id per install and the client persists
the last clock. The reducer also breaks exact HLC ties by event id, so even a
future id collision cannot make state order-dependent.

## 16. Removal is an event, and validation is the door

Reason: the log refuses UPDATE and DELETE, so a malformed or unwanted event
is permanent. `validate_payload` (SQL) and `validateEvent` (core) share one
rule set, the fold skips and counts anything invalid instead of throwing,
and `v1.Redacted` excludes a target from every fold. Reverse if: never; an
append-only log without these is a liability, not a guarantee.

## 17. Bytes are verified on both ends, and the bucket is reconciled

Reason: content addressing only helps if someone checks the content. The
downloader hashes before trusting a file. The confirmation carries the size
so a device can detect a short upload. The reconciler is the server's own
independent pass over the bucket: it confirms what the storage trigger
missed and invalidates what hashes wrong, so blob truth never depends on a
trigger on Supabase's managed storage schema. A fetch failure never
invalidates anything; only bytes that were read and hash wrong do.

## 18. Snapshots travel in pieces

Reason: a Bible-scale snapshot is around 13 MB of JSON. One response on a
weak link fails and restarts. 256 KB pieces, each persisted before the next
is requested, make cold start resumable. The same helper feeds the worker
and the reconciler.

## 19. Read indexes are views, never state

Reason: `deriveTasks` at Bible scale took 27 s because every derivation
rescanned all takes and assignments per unit and lane. The fix is one pass
that builds lookup maps (`packages/core/src/indexes.ts`) and derivations that
take it as an argument. It is not stored in `ProjectState`, not snapshotted,
not synced, and every derive function still works without it, so the fold
and the invariants are untouched. Reverse if: never; a cache inside the
state would have to be kept coherent by the reducer, which is exactly the
trigger-maintained rollup PLAN.md section 2 warns against.

## 20. The spec's flow machine is held to by a test, not a review

Reason: the UX spec declares `flow.ts` its single authority; the app copies
it by hand. `scripts/extractSpecFlow.ts` vendors the spec's screens, edges,
modes and gates into `apps/mobile/test/spec-flow.json` and
`specParity.test.ts` fails on any spec edge the app lacks and any app edge
the spec lacks that is not listed with a reason. The spec's role gates are
now data on our edges and `go()` refuses a gated edge the session cannot
take. Reverse if: the spec repo publishes its machine as a package; then
import it instead of vendoring.

## 21. Blockers are derived, like status

Reason: reachability proves a screen exists, not that the work can finish.
A required step with no eligible reviewer, or an assignee who was removed,
leaves a passage waiting forever with nothing on screen saying why. These
are properties of the fold, so `deriveBlockers` computes them and the status
screen can show the one action that clears each. Reverse if: never.

## 22. One sync client, two folds

Reason: the org partition (roles, memberships, catalog, projects) needs the
same log, outbox, cursor, checkpoint and snapshot handling as a project, and
a different reducer. `SyncClient` takes a `Materializer` (empty, apply, fold,
compact, version); the project one is the default and the org one lives in
core `org.ts`. Reverse if: never; a second sync path is the kind of surface
PLAN.md section 2 exists to avoid.

## 23. Authorization is a privilege, scope is on the membership

Reason: UX spec A38. Roles are named privilege sets; a membership grants a
role at org, project or lane scope; an event needs one privilege
(`EVENT_PRIVILEGE`, mirrored in SQL `event_privilege`). The five fixed roles
are seeded as roles with the spec's privilege sets and `effectiveRole` maps
any privilege set back onto them, so workflow steps, eligibility and storage
policies keep speaking `Role`. Reverse if: partners never define a custom
role; then the seed roles are simply all there is.

## 24. Refusals carry a code, and membership refusals retry themselves

Reason: audit L1. A month of work refused because a role changed offline is
not lost (invariant 1) but was stuck. The server authorizes as of the
event's own clock within a window, and the client re-queues membership
refusals when a pull shows the actor's membership changed. Clock-ahead
refusals re-stamp the clock and keep the event ids. Invalid payloads never
retry.

## 25. Templates instantiate with derived ids, and per-lane settings layer over project settings

Reason: the UX spec applies content templates and review flows per language
(A42) while units and workflow live in the project partition. Deriving
unit and step ids from the catalog (`fia@1/gen-p1`) makes instantiation a
grow-only set: two admins selecting the same template offline emit the same
events and no clone job, ordered insert or server step exists. A lane's
step registers override project-wide ones, which override the old
whole-document config, so nothing existing changes. Reverse if: partners
need one lane to diverge from a template's structure; then hand-added
units already coexist, and a per-lane unit-set event is the next step.

## 26. Reference material is fields, and a question is a field

Reason: audit 5.E. One material with one text register would make two
people filling different blanks of the same document a conflict; per-field
registers make it a merge. Treating a question set as a material whose
fields are the questions means one screen, one lock rule and one scope rule
cover TMF, briefs, guidelines, study material and questions alike, and
`TakeSubmitted.questionSetIds` keeps its shape. Key terms stay grow-only
because every part of a glossary entry is an addition: a rendering, a
recorded adjustment, a link. Reverse if: partners need to edit a rendering
in place; then renderings become registers, and nothing else changes.

## 27. The slideshow mock is the reference for user screens

Reason: "one screen, one task, one main action" is easy to agree with in prose
and easy to drift from in code — the rules that actually bite are the ones
about what happens to a blocked control, where the yellow goes after a step
finishes, and what a recording screen looks like while it is ignoring you.
`docs/ux/one-next-action.html` pins those down in the real tokens and icons,
so a disagreement about an avatar U screen is settled by opening it rather
than by re-reading section 12. It is reference only: not imported, not built,
not tested. Reverse if: partner testing changes the rules; then update the
mock in the same change, or delete it rather than leave it contradicting the
app.

## 28. The partner demo is the reference for screens

Reason: partners test the demo in `ng-langquest-ux` and the app must match
what they approved: its flow, look and wording (Caleb, 2026-09-28). Its
design principles ("a record with advice, not a pipeline with gates") also
replace the one-next-action model, so the app follows the demo rather than
restyling it. Supersedes 7, 8 and 27: screens name the demo screens and
requirement IDs they port instead of an avatar, tokens are the demo's
(`theme.ts`, `kit.tsx`), and `flow.ts` is generated from the demo's flow
and held to it by `specParity.test.ts`. `docs/ux/one-next-action.html` is
kept as history only. Reverse if: the demo stops being maintained; then
this repo's screens become the reference and the parity test is retired.

## 29. A passage's record is read against its language's flow, as advice

Reason: the demo's method is advice with a few hard stops (its ADR-001,
-004, -005, -016). A flow is steps of review kinds that may happen in either
order; a checkpoint is the only gate. So kinds are organization vocabulary
(`v1.ReviewKindDefined`), steps are `v2.WorkflowStepSet` (kinds and a
checkpoint flag instead of v1's role and quorum), reviews attach to a
version for a kind (`v1.ReviewRecorded`: in the app, by link, or logged
afterwards with who gave it), and departing from the method is recorded
with a reason (`v1.DepartureRecorded`, undone by `v1.DepartureUndone`).
Requests, notes and study marks are records too. Status is still derived
(`passage.ts`), and v1 steps and reviews read as kinds, so older lanes keep
working. Merge shapes are the existing ones: grow-only with earliest wins,
registers, and an add-wins undo. Reverse if: partners want gates back; then
checkpoints can cover more steps without new events.

## 30. A back translation is the review's artifacts, not a take

Reason: a back translator usually holds only Review, and a take needs
Translate. Its cards are recorded as source-language audio
(`RecordingAdded` kind `source`, allowed to Review) and named in the
`v1.ReviewRecorded` that records it (outcome `recorded`, `artifactHashes`).
So a back translation can never be mistaken for a version of the passage,
and the kind's step completes by the recording existing. Reverse if: back
translations need editing by cards like versions; then give them their own
take-like event.

## 31. An event may need any one of several privileges

Reason: the demo lets whoever ran a community check log it, translator or
reviewer (its design principle 5), and lets any contributor set a step
aside. One privilege per event type cannot say that. `EVENT_PRIVILEGE` may
name a list, and SQL `event_privilege` returns it comma-separated for
`may_emit` to test by overlap; `scripts/record-parity-sql.ts` holds the two
together. Reverse if: roles become fine-grained enough that each such act
has its own privilege.

## 32. Flow steps belong to a language's selection and are never removed on a switch

Reason: removal is add-wins, so a step id removed once can never come back.
Catalog steps are therefore namespaced by language and flow
(`lane/flow@2/s1`) and choosing another flow only changes the selection;
`deriveFlow` shows the selected flow's steps. Switching back restores the
same steps, and what the record says about them (a checkpoint moved past)
still applies. Hand-edited steps live under the language's `custom` prefix
and new ones get fresh ids. Reverse if: step ids must be shared across
languages; then key overrides and skips by kind instead of step.

## 33. Derived views are cached per state object and revision, outside the state

Reason: the Map and My Work derive every passage in a language at
whole-Bible scale, so `passage.ts` indexes the record once per state. The
app publishes a new top-level state object per change, but a client's
live state is mutated in place, so the reducer counts applied events per
object in a module-level WeakMap (`stateRevision`) and the cache keys on
both. Both live outside the state, so snapshots and the permutation tests
never see them, and the fold stays deterministic. Reverse if: the fold
moves to immutable states; then identity alone is enough.
